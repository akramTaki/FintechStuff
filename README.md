## Prioritize security

## Secure funding

There are several different ways to secure funding for your startup. You could bootstrap, which essentially means you raise all of your own funds without taking money from investors. Other popular funding options include venture capital, crowdfunding, traditional banking loans, and ICO (initial coin offering). Many FinTech startups will likely employ several different fundraising strategies to raise capital and build their product.
